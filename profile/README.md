# QIM Center

At the Center for Quantification of Imaging Data from Max IV (QIM) we develop algorithms for quantitative image analysis. 
The aim of QIM is to support the research carried out at both large and small-scale imaging facilities, including both industrial and clinical applications.

Our team is experienced in analyzing samples across a wide range of scientific disciplines. 
The analysis is carried out either as research projects in close collaboration with experimental scientists or through method and resource support with tools that are freely available to the public (see Software Tools and QIM Platform).
